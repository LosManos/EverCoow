        is.</div> <div>Then also remember that if a friend of yours

        -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"> <div>Besides
        being tracked by the secret police by respective country you are also
        tracked by companies; companies that sometime believe they are above the
        law regarding tracing of email traffic contrary to the Human rights
        agreement that everyone has the right to private
        conversation.</div> <div><br/></div>
        <div>Enough of political talk.  Back to basics.</div>
        <div><br/></div> <div>There are plenty of
        cookies in your web browser and more than a handful of them are used for
        <i>tracking your movements on the web</i>.  Signing out of
        Facebook doesn&apos;t save you - logged in or not doesn&apos;t have to
        do with cookies.  And even though signing out affects your cookies
        visibly, many advertisement companies have banded together for cross
        tracking your cookies.  This means that you are tracked never the less.
         By companies.  That won&apos;t tell you.</div>
        <div><br/></div> <div>Do install something like
        <i>Do not track</i> and you will get a live number of the
        number of tracks on every site you visit.  Oh.  It removes the cookies
        so you don&apos;t get tracked too.</div>
        <div><br/></div> <div>Then we have the search
        result adoption for good and bad.  If you use Google for all your
        searching and you are signed in the result will narrow down.  This is
        called <a href="http://dontbubble.us/">Filter
        bubble</a>.  Either use another browser, a virgin one, for
        searching or Duckduckgo that proxies and anonymises all your searches.
         It also does a cleaning for sites that are only there for getting high
        Google ranks.  Google is on a losing battle there as long as they are
        #1.  As soon as Google updates their page rank algorithm so will sites.
         As a small player Duckduckgo can do a curation.</div>

         Nope.  Not in Sweden.  As the 51st state of USA Sweden still want
