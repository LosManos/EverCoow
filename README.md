EverCoow

A customised Evernote to Google docs converter.


Here is a short explanation of what it is.

I write a news letter with uneven intervals.  I use Evernote to gather stuff.  
When I find myself satisfied I use Applescript to extract xml files from Evernote.  
Then I run a Ruby script to create an XML file and then an HTML file.  
This HTML file I import into Google docs.  An example of the result is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1oa8JG2Eut3vF7WYv5hYf2J3td-Fd4bAHacbENRIzVu8).  
(Linked from [here](http://www.selfelected.com/category/cccommunicate/) if you like it.)

Maybe peut-être kanske möjligen someone else has a need for this code.
