                after-white-space;&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;Besides being tracked by
                the secret police by respective country you are also tracked by
                companies; companies that sometime believe they are above the
                law regarding tracing of email traffic contrary to the Human
                rights agreement that everyone has the right to private
                conversation.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;Enough of political talk.  Back to
                basics.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;There are plenty of cookies in your web browser and
                more than a handful of them are used for &lt;i&gt;tracking your
                movements on the web&lt;/i&gt;.  Signing out of Facebook
                doesn&apos;t save you - logged in or not doesn&apos;t have to do
                with cookies.  And even though signing out affects your cookies
                visibly, many advertisement companies have banded together for
                cross tracking your cookies.  This means that you are tracked
                never the less.  By companies.  That won&apos;t tell
                you.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;Do install something like &lt;i&gt;Do not
                track&lt;/i&gt; and you will get a live number of the number of
                tracks on every site you visit.  Oh.  It removes the cookies
                so you don&apos;t get tracked too.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Then we have the
                search result adoption for good and bad.  If you use Google for
                all your searching and you are signed in the result will narrow
                down.  This is called &lt;a
                href=&quot;http://dontbubble.us/&quot;&gt;Filter
                bubble&lt;/a&gt;.  Either use another browser, a virgin one,
                for searching or Duckduckgo that proxies and anonymises all your
                searches.  It also does a cleaning for sites that are only
                there for getting high Google ranks.  Google is on a losing
                battle there as long as they are #1.  As soon as Google updates
                their page rank algorithm so will sites.  As a small player
                Duckduckgo can do a curation.&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;- &lt;a

                install something like _Do not track_ and you will get a live
