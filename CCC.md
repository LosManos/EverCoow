## Tips for making the adoption of agile successful
Below is linked 10 tips for adopting agile methods.  I immediately want to add an eleventh "Buy in from leaders and wallets."  I have been in too many scrummerfall projects where the leadership calls it Scrum.

## Some Facebook games no longer ask permission to access your profile information
Too give the user a "smooth experience" (my quotes) some Facebook applications can access your stuff without you saying yes.  Isn't this a bit rude, privacy-wise? you might ask.  And it most certainly is.
Then also remember that if a friend of yours installs an application this application gets access to your data too.

## Tracing on the web and DuckDuckGo (web)
Besides being tracked by the secret police by respective country you are also tracked by companies; companies that sometime believe they are above the law regarding tracing of email traffic contrary to the Human rights agreement that everyone has the right to private conversation.

Enough of political talk.  Back to basics.

There are plenty of cookies in your web browser and more than a handful of them are used for _tracking your movements on the web_.  Signing out of Facebook doesn't save you - logged in or not doesn't have to do with cookies.  And even though signing out affects your cookies visibly, many advertisement companies have banded together for cross tracking your cookies.  This means that you are tracked never the less.  By companies.  That won't tell you.

Do install something like _Do not track_ and you will get a live number of the number of tracks on every site you visit.  Oh.  It removes the cookies so you don't get tracked too.

Then we have the search result adoption for good and bad.  If you use Google for all your searching and you are signed in the result will narrow down.  This is called <a href='http://dontbubble.us/'>Filter bubble</a>.  Either use another browser, a virgin one, for searching or Duckduckgo that proxies and anonymises all your searches.  It also does a cleaning for sites that are only there for getting high Google ranks.  Google is on a losing battle there as long as they are #1.  As soon as Google updates their page rank algorithm so will sites.  As a small player Duckduckgo can do a curation.

## Clemency petition (nådeansökan) for Peter Sunde
Whether you like the doings of The pirate bay or not they did one thing: they lifted the abuse of power from the big media companies to the eyes of the public.  The politicians have yet to understand.

Will PSunde succeed?  Nope.  Not in Sweden.  As the 51st state of USA Sweden still want the ACTA agreement to pass.  And that rhymes badly with letting the people decide.
